# Linkable Ring Signature


### Abstract

Ring signature is an anonymous signature that both authenticates the message and protects
the identity information of the signer. The signer can generate multiple different signatures for the same message without being discovered by the verifier.
Linkable ring signature (LRS) resolves the problem of duplicity. The verifier can determine if multiple signatures were generated by the same signer, but he cannot determine the actual signerâ€™s identity.


### Implementation

Signature is based on elliptic curve [Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA), due to high-speed and high-security.
Features and software is described on [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/).
As a hash function is used [SHA-3 Keccak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3),
the latest member of the [Secure Hash Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms) family of standards, released by [NIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology).

This library is written in language [Go](https://golang.org/).
It uses functions from the project of cryptocurrency [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).


### Source taken over

The code of main functions [Sign](https://github.com/zbohm/lirisi/blob/master/ring/signature.go#L69) and [VerifySign](https://github.com/zbohm/lirisi/blob/master/ring/signature.go#L216) was taken from the project [ring-go](https://github.com/noot/ring-go). This implementation is based on "Ring Confidential Transactions" proposed for cryptocurrency Monero:
https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098.pdf.

### Install

First install [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) if you do not have it in the OS.
Install the application with the command:

```
go get github.com/zbohm/lirisi
```


### Simple console client

This project is primarily a library, but after installation you have a simple client at your disposal. Enter the command `lirisi`:

```
Usage:
  lirisi [params] COMMAND

Commands:
  create-private-key

Examples:
  lirisi create-private-key > private-key.hex
  lirisi --output=private-key.hex create-private-key
```
